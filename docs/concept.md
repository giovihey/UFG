# Concept

This section explains the fundamental aspects of your distributed systems project.

## Project Type

Describe the type of product being developed:

- **Application** (GUI-based: mobile, web, or desktop)
- **Command-line application** (CLI for human or script usage)
- **Library** (reusable components)
- **Web service(s)** (backend services)

## Use Case Description

Address the following aspects:

### What
What is the software doing?


### Where
Where are the users located?


### When and Frequency
When and how frequently do they interact with the system?


### How and Devices
How do users interact with the system? Which devices are they using?


### Data Storage
Does the system need to store user's data? Which data? Where?


### User Roles
Describe the multiple roles involved in the system.


## Why is distribution needed?

### Geographical Distribution
Are components distributed across different geographic locations?


### Computation Speedup
Is parallel computation needed to improve performance?


### Resource Sharing
Do multiple users or components need access to shared resources?


### Fault Tolerance
Is high availability and failure recovery critical?


### Other Reasons
Are there other reasons justifying distribution?
